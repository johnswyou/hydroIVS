# hydroIVS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package implements several input variable selection methods.
Currently implemented methods are:

- `none`: No input variable selection
- `boruta`: Input Variable Selection using the Boruta algorithm.
- `rrf`: Input Variable Selection (IVS) using feature importance scores
  from fitting a regularized random forrest (rrf) regression model.
- `ea_cmi_htc`: Edgeworth Approximation (EA) based Shannon Conditional
  Mutual Information (CMI) Input Variable Selection (IVS) using the
  Hampel Test Criterion (HTC) to identify significant inputs.
- `ea_cmi_tol`: Edgeworth Approximation (EA) based Shannon Conditional
  Mutual Information (CMI) Input Variable Selection (IVS) using ratio of
  CMI over Mutual Information (MI) to identify significant inputs.
- `knn_cmi_tol`: K nearest neighbour (KNN) based Shannon Conditional
  Mutual Information (CMI) Input Variable Selection (IVS) using ratio of
  CMI over Mutual Information (MI) to identify significant inputs.
- `knn_cmi_bi_tol`: Bias Improved (BI) K nearest neighbour (KNN) based
  Shannon Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) Input Variable Selection
  (IVS) using ratio of CMI over Mutual Information (MI) to identify
  significant inputs.
- `pmis_bic`: Partial Mutual Information Selection (PMIS) using the
  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to identify significant inputs.
- `pcis_bic`: Partial Correlation Input Selection (PCIS) using the
  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to identify significant inputs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `hydroIVS` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("johnswyou/hydroIVS")
```

## Example

Here is a basic example:

``` r
library(hydroIVS)

X <- matrix(rnorm(1e4*100), ncol=100)
y <- rnorm(1e4)

ivsIOData(y, X, ivsm = "pcis_bic")
#> $sel_inputs
#> [1] 75
#> 
#> $names_sel_inputs
#> NULL
#> 
#> $scores
#> [1] 0.000549
```
